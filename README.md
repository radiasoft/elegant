# Resources related to the 'elegant' code from Argonne National Laboratory

Elegant simulates all types of charged particle accelerators with a wide range of features, including support for nonlinear optimization and design. Elegant is ![freely available](https://www1.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator-Operations-Physics/Software). A ![user manual](http://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Accelerator_Operations_Physics/manuals/elegant_latest/elegant.html) is provided, and there is also an active ![online user forum](https://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Accelerator_Operations_Physics/phpBB3/). The code is primarily supported by ![Michael Borland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-borland-3a228526/) and colleagues at the ![Argonne National Laboratory](https://www1.aps.anl.gov/). Contributors include M. Borland, M. Carla, N. Carmignani, M. Ehrlichman, L. Emery, W. Guo, R. Lindberg, V. Sajaev, R. Soliday, Y.-P. Sun, C.-X. Wang, Y. Wang, Y. Wu and A. Xiao.
