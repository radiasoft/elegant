Scripts to perform coupling correction for the APS ring, emulating what is done
in APS operations.

M. Borland, APS

run0.ele
        Runs the full lattice to test and get twiss parameters

makeSkewKnobFiles
        Makes a set of knob files for use in coupling minimization using run0.twi

makeSkewReponse
skewResponseTemplate.ele
        Script and template for computing response of s36 to skew strength, plus inverse

correctCoupling
        Script to perform coupling correction and adjust vertical emittance
        Uses skewResponse.inv and skew knob files.
        Also uses
        etayCorrTemplate.ele --- Template file for etay correction
        couplingCorrTemplate.ele --- Template file for coupling minimization and ey setting
