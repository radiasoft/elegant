Example of using linear chromatic tracking mode for fast tracking in a
storage ring with higher-order chromatic effects and damping.  In this
example, we use the use_linear_chromatic_matrix control on the track
command.  Another method is using ILMATRIX, which is actually
preferred as it is more flexible.

We also show how to correct the chromaticity and perform parameter
saving/loading.

See track1.ele for details.
