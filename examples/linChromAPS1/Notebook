Example of using linear chromatic tracking mode for fast tracking in a
storage ring with chromatic effects and damping.  In this example, we
use the use_linear_chromatic_matrix control on the track command.
Another method is using ILMATRIX, which is actually preferred as it is
more flexible.

We also show how to correct the chromaticity in this example.

See track1.ele for details.
